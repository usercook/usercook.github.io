  <h1>The Talibans' ban on girls' education</h1>
</div>

On this tuesday, the 20th of December 2022, the Taliban government’s Ministry of Higher Education announced in a <br /> 
letter that, until further notice, women would be banned from going to University. Last year, when the Talibans returned, <br />
they had already prevented girls from going to secondary school, which means girls can now only complete school until 6th grade. <br />
</p>
On the day after the announcement, students were seen waiting outside their schools’ gates, trying to get inside by negotiating. <br />

<h4> Security personnel refuse to let female students into Kabul University, on December 21, 2022. WAKIL KOHSAR / AFP </h4>

A teacher, who decided to use a nickname - Sumaya - tried to negotiate to let her students in, without success. <br />
All the [female] students were forced to leave by guards, who were patrolling the city of Kabul, and especially university. <br />
</p>
This announcement resulted in protests staged by women of the university, in the capital of Kabul. <br />
</p>
"Today we come out on the streets of Kabul to raise our voices against the closure of the <br />
girls' universities," protesters from the Afghanistan Women's Unity and Solidarity group said. <br />
</p>
Unfortunately, the small demonstrations were rapidly overrun, since the Taliban guards were armed. <br />
</p>
The students present at the demonstrations testify their shock and despair over losing their future. <br />
One student told the BBC that she was studying Sharia Islamic Law, and that she didn’t agree with the Taliban’s regime, <br />
as it contradicted with Islam. <br />
</p>
On Thursday, in some Afghan cities, girls were even sent home from primary schools. Female teachers reportedly lost their jobs.<br />
A gathering of school principals and spiritual leaders this week said women in Afghanistan should no longer be allowed to work <br />
as teachers or visit mosques, though an official decision has not yet been announced. <br />
</p>
Shaharzad Akbar, the former head of the Afghan Human Rights Commission, said that with half of the population not having access  <br />
to an education, the Afghan population will remain poor, and will have to stay dependent on the international community. <br />
This will aggravate the already existent hunger crisis. <br />
</p>
In the capital, about two dozen women marched in the streets, chanting for freedom and equality. “All or none. Don’t be afraid. We are together,” they chanted. <br />
</p>
In a video obtained by The Associated Press, a girl declares that guards used violence in order to disperse the demonstrations.  <br />
« The girls were beaten and whipped », she says . « They also brought military women with them, whipping the girls » <br />
Some of the protesters were arrested, causing disarray amongst the population. <br />
</p>
The Taliban-run government that announced the ban said it was partly because of the female students not obeying to the islamic  <br />
dress code, in gender-mixed schools. They also stated «Girls were studying agriculture and engineering, but this didn’t match Afghan culture. <br />
Girls should learn, but not in areas that go against Islam and Afghan honour.” <br />
</p>

   <h3>The World's reaction:</h3>

</p>
When Afghanistan's Taliban rulers issued a decree last month banning women from the country's universities, the move was lambasted <br />
around the world as amoral and un-Islamic. <br />
</p>
Afghan politician and Islamic feminist Shukria Barakzai says now is the time for global action. Barakzai once studied <br />
in Kabul but was unable to finish her degree because the Taliban came to power in the 1990s. <br />
"The Taliban have proven that they systematically discriminate against women," she told DW. "The people of Afghanistan <br />
and the international community should push back collectively and not forget the responsibility they hold towards women." <br />
</p>
Earlier on Thursday, the foreign ministers of the G-7 group of states urged the Taliban to rescind the ban, warning that <br /> 
“gender persecution may amount to a crime against humanity.” The ministers warned after a virtual meeting that <br />
 “Taliban policies designed to erase women from public life will have consequences for how our countries engage with the Taliban.” <br />
 The G-7 group includes Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, the United States and the European Union. <br />
</p>

  <h3>The World's reaction:</h3>

</p>
In Afghanistan, there has been some domestic opposition to the university ban, including from several cricketers. <br />
Cricket is a hugely popular sport in the country, and players have hundreds of thousands of followers on social media. <br />
</p>
Another show of support for female university students came at Nangarhar Medical University. Local media reported that <br />
male students walked out in solidarity and refused to sit for exams until women’s university access was reinstated. <br />
 the US warning the Taliban would be held to account.

“This unacceptable stance will have significant consequences for the Taliban and will further alienate the Taliban from <br />
the international community,” said state department spokesperson Ned Price. The UN was “deeply concerned” by the order, <br />
said Ramiz Alakbarov, the secretary general’s deputy special representative for Afghanistan. <br />
“Education is a fundamental human right. A door closed to women’s education is a door closed to the future of Afghanistan,” he tweeted. <br />
Responding to the ban, the International Rescue Committee stated that: “The closure of universities to women and girls is a chilling <br />
step backwards for Afghanistan. There are no two ways about it: women must be allowed to work and to move freely, and girls must <br />
be allowed to continue to go to school.”
